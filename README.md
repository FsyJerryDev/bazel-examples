# Learn Bazel from examples

## Introduction

When I learned cmak a few years ago, I benefitted a lot from the famous Github project [cmake-examples](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples). Inspired by this project and learning how to use Bazel from scratch, I think it is a good idea to provide people with some examples which can help them learn Bazel more easily.

## Requirements

Every time I prepare to learn some new things which are more than just technology, I wish to have a user-friendly guidance which can help me learn these things more easily. Hence, I wish to provide a user-friendly guidance about how to prepare the environment for Bazel.

### Windows:

The basic requirements are:

- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (you can download from the following link [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170))

    - 

- Bazel (you can download Bazel from the following link [Downloading Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases))

    -

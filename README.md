# Learn Bazel from examples

## Introduction

When I learned cmak a few years ago, I benefitted a lot from the famous Github project [cmake-examples](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples). Inspired by this project and I am learning how to use Bazel from scratch, I think it is a good idea to provide people with some examples which can help them learn Bazel more easily.
